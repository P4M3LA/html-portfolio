<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Paul and I am currently at level 21 in the game of life.</p>

<p>Fun fact/story: I have a nickname as well. In school, writing our names on the paper, I would write somewhat fast and sloppy. So, when I turned my paper for it to be graded, my teacher would ask the class who "Pam" is. Looking around, no one else with a "P" in their name, I would raise my hand, lol. The "U" and "L" connected to look like an "M". Since then, "Pam" has stuck with me, and my friends have kept calling me by that new nickname.</p>

<p>I enjoy going outdoors. I love the mountains and the forest. Pine trees are my favourite at the moment. I picked up Rock Climbing recently, started last year. I have yet to go climb outdoors. Climbing is a total body work-out and also works the brain to problem solve a route. Like, which handhold looks good? what technique or position should you use on the next move? It is very fun and the community is extremely helpful and open to all.</p>

<p>Other things I enjoy are video games, drumming and music. I like to play almost everything. 2D platformers, Fighting, RPGs, etc. My main game, that I'm good at, is Rocket League. It is basically soccer/football but you play as an RC car. It is very technical and a unique game of its own.</p>

<p>I have been playing drums since I was around 5 or 6 years old. Either way, I've been playing for 10+ years now. Joining band class was very fun and I learned a lot. At my old High School Marching Band, my Freshman year I played in the Front Ensemble as a Vibraphone player. Later on in my Jr. Year, I became Center Snare. Meaning I was leading and having the rest of the percussionists follow my tempo as we marched on the field. I got the position because many of my other band mates believed that I was great and determined enough for it. Thanks to them I was able to prove, not only them, but myself as well that I was good for it.</p>

<p>Music a passion of mine. I enjoy most genres but the ones I like the most are Rock and Metal. With Rock, I like classic, punk, post-punk, alternative and many others that I can't think of right now. Metal music can vary a lot. I listen mostly to heavier metal. Such as, Deathcore, Hardcore, Thrash, and Nu Metal. My Father is the one who had gotten me into Rock/Metal. First album he showed me was Metallica's "Death Magnetic". I've heard many other songs of his, but Metallica got me hooked. So, from there, I began to listn to more and more of his kinds of music. Some with clean vocals, some with screams, and even some that are just instrumentals.</p>
